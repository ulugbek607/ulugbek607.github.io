# Project Overview

This repository serves as Ulugbek Amankulov's academic and professional portfolio, designed for university applications, scholarships, and professional review. It showcases their achievements, including a professional portfolio document, various certificates, and details about their Taekwondo and TOPIK language proficiency. The owner is a high school student in South Korea aiming for Business Marketing / Business Administration studies, with a background in Software Development.

## Key Files and Directories

*   **`README.md`**: Provides a comprehensive overview of the portfolio, including academic background, contents, and purpose.
*   **`MY_PORTFOLIO_2026.pdf`**: The main professional portfolio document.
*   **`certificates/`**: A directory intended to hold certificate files (though individual files are also present in the root).
*   **`gtq hangeul.jfif`**: A certificate image related to GTQ Hangul.
*   **`gtq.jfif`**: A certificate image related to GTQ (likely Photoshop, based on previous context).
*   **`photo_2026-01-27_12-41-06.jpg`**: A personal photo, possibly used for the portfolio.

## Building and Running

This is a static content repository designed to be served directly by GitHub Pages. There are no explicit build or run commands in the traditional software development sense. The content is accessible via the GitHub Pages URL associated with this repository.

## Development Conventions

*   **Content Focus**: The repository is primarily for displaying static documents and images.
*   **Updates**: The `README.md` indicates the repository is "Actively updated," suggesting ongoing maintenance and addition of new achievements.
*   **Documentation**: The `README.md` is well-structured and provides clear information about the repository's contents and purpose.

## Future Interactions

To make changes to this portfolio, you would typically:
1.  Modify the relevant `.pdf`, `.jfif`, or `.jpg` files.
2.  Update the `README.md` to reflect any new content or achievements.
3.  Commit and push changes to the `main` branch of this repository.

If new HTML/CSS/JS files are introduced to create a more interactive web page, new build/run instructions would need to be defined.
